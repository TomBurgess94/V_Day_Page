            <p>My wonderful sweetheart,<br> <br>
                Being with you for the past 3 years has been the most amazing experience and I fall more in love with you every day. I feel like you make me a better person
                (my diet has even gotten better since being with you!!!). Asking you to move in with me was the best thing I've ever done and you saying yes was the best thing
                I've ever heard. This year of living together has been a dream come true, going to sleep next to you every night and acting like a couple of absolute dorks every
                evening is the most amazing life, even if my "boy" flat is now a couple flat. I'm sure this time next year there will be twice as many fairy lights!<br>
                You're the best girlfriend ever, and seeing you grow as a person is so exciting. I've been so lucky to see you make your ambition become reality and 
                having you be so comfortable, and being your true self makes me the happiest man alive.<br> <br>
                I love you, plenty
            </p>
